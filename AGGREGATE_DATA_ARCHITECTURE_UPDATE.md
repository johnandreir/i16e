# Aggregate Data Workflow - Architecture Update

## Summary of Changes

I have successfully updated the workflow architecture as requested:

### 1. Renamed Workflow

- **Old Name**: "Aggregate Performance Data"
- **New Name**: "Aggregate Data"

### 2. Updated Trigger Mechanism

**Previous Architecture**:

- Calculate Metrics → HTTP POST to webhook
- Process Survey → HTTP POST to webhook
- Aggregate Performance Data triggered by webhook

**New Architecture**:

- Get Cases → Calculate Metrics + Process Survey (parallel)
- Both workflows complete → Trigger "Aggregate Data" workflow
- Aggregate Data uses `executeWorkflowTrigger` instead of webhook

### 3. Workflow Changes Made

#### Get Cases.json

- Added "Wait for Both Workflows Complete" node (IF node)
- Added "Trigger Aggregate Data" node (Execute Workflow node)
- Updated connections:
  - Calculate Metrics → Wait node
  - Process Survey → Wait node
  - Wait node → Trigger Aggregate Data

#### Calculate metrics.json

- Reverted HTTP Request node back to simple "Done" node
- No longer makes HTTP calls to aggregation workflow
- Lets Get Cases workflow handle the aggregation trigger

#### Process Survey.json

- Reverted HTTP Request node back to simple "Done" node
- No longer makes HTTP calls to aggregation workflow
- Lets Get Cases workflow handle the aggregation trigger

#### Aggregate Data.json (New Structure)

- Uses `executeWorkflowTrigger` instead of webhook trigger
- Triggered only after both Calculate Metrics AND Process Survey complete
- Collects today's performance data from MongoDB
- Aggregates metrics and satisfaction data for final dashboard consumption

## New Execution Flow

```
Get Cases Webhook
    ↓
Prepare Entity Data
    ↓
┌─ Calculate Metrics ─┐
│                     ├─→ Wait for Both Complete
└─ Process Survey ────┘       ↓
                        Trigger Aggregate Data
                              ↓
                        MongoDB Aggregation
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Sequential Execution**: Aggregate Data only runs after BOTH workflows complete
2. **No Race Conditions**: Eliminates timing issues between metrics and satisfaction data
3. **Cleaner Architecture**: Single trigger point instead of multiple HTTP calls
4. **Better Error Handling**: If either workflow fails, aggregation doesn't run
5. **Resource Efficiency**: No webhook polling or HTTP overhead

## Files Updated

- ✅ `Get cases.json` - Added wait and trigger nodes
- ✅ `Calculate metrics.json` - Reverted to simple completion
- ✅ `Process Survey.json` - Reverted to simple completion
- ⚠️ `Aggregate Data.json` - Needs manual creation in n8n with executeWorkflowTrigger

## Next Steps

1. Import the updated workflow files into n8n
2. Manually create the "Aggregate Data" workflow with:
   - Execute Workflow Trigger node
   - Data collection and aggregation logic
   - MongoDB operations for final data persistence
3. Update the workflow ID references in "Trigger Aggregate Data" nodes
4. Test the complete flow: Get Cases → Both workflows → Aggregation

The architecture now ensures that the Aggregate Data workflow is triggered only when both Calculate Metrics and Process Survey workflows have completed successfully.
