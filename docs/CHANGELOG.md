### Script Organization

**Root Directory:**
- `start-full-dev.bat` - Complete development environment startup
- `start.bat` - Backend services only
- `stop.bat` - Stop all backend services

**Scripts Directory:**
- `check-health.bat` - Service health monitoring
- `view-logs.bat` - Interactive Docker log viewer
- `cleanup.bat` - Container and volume cleanup
- `cleanup-docker-env.bat` - Complete environment cleanup
- `monitor-connection.bat` - Connection monitoring
- `restart-with-fixes.bat` - Service restart with fixes
- `apply-emergency-fix.bat` - Emergency fix application
- `update-status-display.bat` - Status display updates

### Hybrid Architecture Benefits

- **Backend Services**: Containerized in Docker for consistency and isolation
- **Frontend Development**: Local with hot reload for fast development
- **Single Configuration**: One docker-compose.yml for all backend services
- **Fast Startup**: Backend ready in ~30 seconds, no frontend rebuilds needed
- **Easy Debugging**: Local frontend with containerized backend services

### Enhanced Features Documented

- Loading spinners and notifications for analysis operations
- Enhanced pie charts with hover effects and consistent outlines
- Real-time n8n workflow status showing active workflows from container logs
- Comprehensive service monitoring and health checks
- Theme-aware UI components and enhanced user feedback

### Files Confirmed as Current
- `docs/SERVER_FILES.md` - Already accurate and up-to-date
- `docs/FIELD_NAMING.md` - Current naming conventions documented correctly

All documentation now accurately reflects the current project structure, available scripts, Docker configuration, and enhanced features implemented in the DevOps Insight Engine.
